# Password-Generator
Javascript Homework

This weeks homework was to create a random password generator.

It works by:
-Gathering input from the user to declare how long they would like the password (Requirement 8-128 charcters)
-Gathering input from the user  to choose which characters were to be used (Uppercase, Lowercase, Numbers, Special Characters)
-Making sure the user can only declare a numerical value when prompted for the length. (Using .isNaN)
-Making sure the user declares at least 1 type of character to be used (Otherwise it will not be read)

Using a combination of concepts learned over the last 2 weeks made this possible:
-variables, constants, and let
-strings and arrays
-conditionals (if and else)
-functions
-concat
-alert
-prompt
-confirm
-For Loops
-math.random (especially)
